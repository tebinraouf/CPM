 Assumptions
 1. First line is the header
 2. The input is comma separated
 3. The input should be in the following format order:
    TaskName,Duration,Predecessor
 4. If there are more than one predecessor, separate them with a comma such as
    B,2,C,D,E
 5. If a task doesn't have any predecessors, it should be labeled NA
